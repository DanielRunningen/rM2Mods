# Suspended Screen Assets

The default `suspended.png` image is a white canvas with black text in the center that reads "reMarkable is sleeping", which leads to some confusion in regards to the file's name.
`suspended.png` is the correct file name.
This image is invoked when a user physically presses the device button or the device sits in the sleeping state for an extended period of time.

Replacement images for this feature are found in the `assets/suspension` directory of this repo.

Example:

<p align="middle">
   <img src="https://github.com/DanielRunningen/rM2Mods/blob/main/assests/suspension/sebastian.png" width="30%" />
</p>

# Sleep Screen Assets

This directory consists of replacement images for this "Auto sleep" feature.
By default, this setting invokes the `sleeping.png` image after the device has been left alone for 20 minutes.
This feature can be turned off in the device settings under the "Battery" section's "Auto sleep" toggle.

The original image is a simple, black, 120 pixel tall banner across the top of the device that reads "Press button to continue" in a white, sans-serif font.
The rest of the page is taken up by the contents of the screen that were last visible prior to enabling sleep mode.
This is helpful if you want a particular page mostly visible as a reference, but would like to limit battery usage.

## Waves

This asset comes in several variants. Each has an orientation of diagonal, horizontal, or vertical and an opacity of 50 or 100%.

Each wave was generated on a grid of 26 pixel squares using the smart curve of the pen tool and alternating between two parallel lines of the grid. The line was stroked in 1pt black.

## Z Border

This asset comes in two styles, one where the text is an opaque white and another where the text is transparent.

<div style="background-color:lightgrey;border-radius:10px;padding:10px;">

</div>

The band is 50 pixels wide around all edges. The text ranges from 14 to 26 pixels in height and is centered along the width of the band. The characters are a mix of capital and lowercase Segoe Print font.
